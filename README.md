Note: Updates arrives slower on Google Play Store and F-droid store. The apps must be checked by playstore while rebuilt completely on f-droid. Playstore usually delays updates by few hours or 1 day to be max in most cases while F-droid can take upto 4 days to show latest releases. So if you want faster releases you can get it from github or wait for playstore to make update available.
